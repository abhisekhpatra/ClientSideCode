        <h4 align="center">Title: Role of color and affect in information visualization </h4>  
        <p>Principal Investigator: Dr. Lyn Bartram and Abhisekh Patra, SIAT, Simon Fraser University Contact: apatra@sfu.ca , +1 604-376-8384/lyn@sfu.ca , +1 778-782-7439</p>
<p>The Simon Fraser University Ethics Board has approved this research study.
This consent form, a copy of which is made available to you, is part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more details about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should feel free to ask the investigator(s). Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand the information.
<h4 align="left" ><b>Purpose of the Study</b></h4>  
The purpose of this study will be to understand how visual designers explore, use and manipulate color to enhance affect in information visualization.
<h4 align="left" ><b>Participant Recruitment and Selection</b></h4>  
You must be over 19 years of age and have no major physical or cognitive disabilities. You should have at least 1 year of experience in design. 
<h4 align="left" ><b>Remuneration</b></h4>
You will be considered for CAD $200 cash draw. You will not suffer any disadvantage or reprisal for withdrawing prior to the point of completion and that you will still be considered for the cash draw. 
<h4 align="left" ><b>Risk</b></h4>
Risk for you include a minimal experience of boredom in performing the tasks. You might get tired/annoyed in coloring the graphs. To reduce this, you can log off and login at your preference to continue your sessions.
<h4 align="left" ><b> Study Method</b></h4> 
You will be provided with 2 kinds of chart –bar and map chart. Each chart will further have two categories representing either categorical or diverging values and you will have to color each chart to represent positive-negative, trustworthy, disturbing, serious-playful, and calm-exciting. There will be a total of 10 tasks and takes approximately 10-15 minutes for completing. Before you start the task you will be performing a training to make you familiar with the tool usage. Each task has clear instructions for you to follow. Once each task is completed you will need to submit the details for further analysis.We will be storing your color choices for further analysis.
<h4 align="left" ><b>Data Collection</b></h4>
For Analysis, the color choices will be saved by us for further analysis. Data collection such as color choices and email id of the participant will be kept confidential and protected. You have the option to participate (or not) over such mediums. The data will be kept in secure SFU server and will be deleted after analysis and interpretation from the data is done.For Analysis, the design generated will be saved by us for further analysis. Data collection such as notes and audio of the interview will be kept anonymous.  If you choose to participate in the study using an online communication tool such as Skype, we cannot fully guarantee your anonymity because data is transmitted over the Internet. You have the option to participate (or not) over such mediums. The data will be kept in secure SFU server and will be deleted after analysis and interpretation from the data is done.
